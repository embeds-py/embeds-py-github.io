This tool can help you get a grip on Discord Embeds (a topic some people are struggling with), it provides a simple ui to construct a message you want, as well as a realtime preview.

You can also see the code needed to generate the same Embed inside your own cog in real time, so you can see how different fields and values affect the end result, which is pretty neat, if you ak me ;)

Hope you like it!
